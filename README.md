## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

* Learned more about variant fonts. How they work and how to use them.
* Used @layer in CSS to organize the code.
* Modular CSS for the card component. I learned more about encapsulating CSS in a 
way that makes it easy to reuse.


### Continued development

Continue gathering feedback from the mods at FEM and keep building! Next, I intend to finish the beginner path and move on to full pages, then sites.


### Useful resources

- [MDN: font-variation-settings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variation-settings) - Helped a bit with the variable fonts. Still need to dive deeper.
- [CSS In Depth](https://www.manning.com/books/css-in-depth) - Great book I've been using to help me learn CSS. Covers a ton of modern practices that helped update my skills.
